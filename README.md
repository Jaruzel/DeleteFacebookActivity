# Delete Facebook Activity
Simple Tool to Crawl Facebook and Delete All Your Activity #DeleteFacebook

* Compiles with Visual Studio 2017
* Targets .NET Framework 4
* Badly Written Unoptimised VB.NET

Yes, yes, it's VB. Stop complaining... 

...Once I got it working, I'd never have run it again (Hopefully). Feel free to port the logic to something else ;)
